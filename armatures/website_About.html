        <p>My name is Liz Aitken. I have been a professional artist for about 5 years now. I have also had the privilege of being a program manager for a small, but wonderful organization that helps families in a rural area in Mexico have the supplies they need to send their children to school.  I have had so many adventures with both of these jobs and have loved most every minute. However, now I am 
                embarking on a new adventure...one through the jungles of software development! Most people in my life have asked me why I am choosing software development. There is a certain perception that software development and the tech industry is only for those with a certain type of perspective…the slightly more left-brained individuals, the Sheldon Coopers of the world. Now, obviously, I am not an expert (yet), but thus far, I have discovered this field to be one filled with problem-solving, building, and fixing. One that starts with an abstract concept and develops it into something tangible and real. Well, to me that sounds an awful lot like what I do with wax, paint, and ink. So, I think I am just going to go learn a new medium now…and maybe create something cool.</p>
